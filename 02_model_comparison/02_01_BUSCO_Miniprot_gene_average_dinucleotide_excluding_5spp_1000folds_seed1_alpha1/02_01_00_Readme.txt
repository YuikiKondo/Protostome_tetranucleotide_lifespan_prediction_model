The input file of 02_01_01_dinucleotide_rates_reshape_for_elasticnet_Github_check.py: "filtered_species_with_zero_lifecycle_6_categories_Github_check.csv" is the modified file of the output from 05_04_09_extract_all_zero_lifehistory_in_6_categories.py in the repository: https://github.com/YuikiKondo/protostome_lifespan_DNA_mechanics.

This modification is the exclusion of three species (Magicicada septendecula, Macrobrachium hainanense and Eledone cirrhosa).
Because BUSCO predictions with Augustus failed in these three species, these species were excluded for fair comparisons in Figure 3a (to use the same Train/Test dataset).
